1. Architecture Overview:
The architecture will be based on a simple web application with frontend, backend, and a database.

Components:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (No complex libraries or frameworks).
Backend: Node.js with Express (for handling RESTful API requests).
Database: JSON file storage or SQLite for a lightweight, serverless database.
Location API: OpenStreetMap for basic location tagging.
Communication:
Frontend will communicate with the backend using REST API.
Backend will interact with the database (JSON or SQLite) to store/retrieve posts.

2. Features:
Post Announcements: Allow residents to post simple announcements.
View Posts: A feed where users can view all posts from neighbors.
Location Tagging: Users can manually add a location to their post, visualized on a map.
Basic Map Integration: Use OpenStreetMap to display general location context for posts.

3. Project Plan (Tasks, Timelines, and Checklists)
Week 1: Setup & Initial Planning
Task 1: Set up project repository (GitHub or GitLab).
Task 2: Initialize Node.js project (npm init).
Task 3: Create the frontend structure (HTML, CSS).
Checklist:
Basic HTML page.
Simple CSS layout for the announcement form and feed.
Task 4: Set up Express server for backend.
Checklist:
Install Express (npm install express).
Create basic server to serve the frontend.
Week 2: Backend Development & Database Integration
Task 1: Implement API for posting and retrieving announcements.
Checklist:
Create POST /posts route to accept new announcements.
Create GET /posts route to fetch all posts.
Task 2: Integrate database for storing posts.
Checklist:
Use a JSON file or SQLite for storage.
Ensure proper storage and retrieval of posts.
Task 3: Implement basic validation for input fields (announcements).
Checklist:
Validate post content before saving.
Week 3: Frontend Integration & Map Feature
Task 1: Create the post submission form (HTML).
Checklist:
Fields for title and content of the post.
Location input (text-based, simple).
Task 2: Implement the post feed to display all posts.
Checklist:
Dynamically display posts from backend.
Display location as a simple text field.
Task 3: Integrate OpenStreetMap (using static maps or simple markers).
Checklist:
Add map to each post to show location context.
Week 4: Testing & Deployment
Task 1: Test the application (Frontend and Backend).
Checklist:
Ensure posts can be submitted and retrieved.
Check map integration.
Ensure validation is working.
Task 2: Deployment (Heroku, Vercel, or local server).
Checklist:
Deploy frontend and backend on the selected platform.
Ensure the app is accessible and functional in production.
