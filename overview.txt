Simplified Project: Neighborhood Community Hub
Problem: Neighbors find it challenging to connect and share information or resources within their community.

Solution: Build a basic web platform where residents can post announcements and view posts from their neighborhood.

Simplified Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for a straightforward and static user interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express for handling basic API requests.
Database: JSON file storage or a lightweight SQLite database for managing posts.
APIs: Use a simple location-based API like OpenStreetMap to display the area context without complex integrations.
Core Features:

Post Announcements: Users can submit simple text-based announcements.
View Posts: Residents can view a feed of announcements posted by others.
Location Tagging: Posts can include a general location tag based on user input, displayed using a basic map.
Project Steps:

Frontend:

Create a simple HTML page with a form for submitting posts.
Display a list of posts on the same page.
Use CSS for basic styling and layout.
Backend:

Set up a basic Express server with routes for:
Submitting a new post (POST /posts).
Fetching all posts (GET /posts).
Store posts in a JSON file or SQLite database.
Database:

Use a JSON file to store posts locally or SQLite for a minimal database setup.
Location API Integration:

Use OpenStreetMap's static maps API to show the general location of posts.
No complex user location detectionâ€”users input a simple location manually.
Benefits:

Low Complexity: Focuses on the essential functionality without complex features.
Quick Setup: Can be developed and deployed quickly.
Scalable: Additional features like user authentication, richer location services, or a more dynamic frontend can be added later.
This simplified version provides a functional foundation for community interaction while being easy to develop and maintain.
